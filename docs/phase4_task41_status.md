## Component Details

### 1. HealthMonitor (`fault_tolerance.rs`)

**Purpose:** Centralized health tracking and graceful degradation

**Key Features:**
- Lock-free concurrent component tracking via DashMap
- Weighted availability calculation: `A = Σ(wᵢ · hᵢ) / Σ(wᵢ)`
- Automatic stale component detection (30s timeout)
- System state transitions based on availability thresholds
- Comprehensive health reporting

**API:**
```rust
pub struct HealthMonitor {
    components: Arc<DashMap<String, ComponentHealth>>,
    stale_timeout: Duration,
    degraded_threshold: f64,  // Default: 0.9
    critical_threshold: f64,  // Default: 0.5
}

// Usage
let monitor = HealthMonitor::default();
monitor.register_component("service", 1.0);  // weight: 1.0 = critical
monitor.mark_healthy("service")?;
let state = monitor.system_state();  // Running, Degraded, or Critical
```

**Tests:** 11/11 passing
- Component health creation/updates
- Registration and health updates
- System availability calculations
- State transitions
- Weighted availability
- Health reporting

### 2. CircuitBreaker (`circuit_breaker.rs`)

**Purpose:** Isolate failing components to prevent cascading failures

**Key Features:**
- Three-state machine: Closed → Open → HalfOpen → Closed
- Exponential moving average (EMA) failure rate tracking
- Configurable failure threshold and recovery timeout
- Automatic trial operations after recovery timeout
- Thread-safe operation wrapping

**Mathematical Model:**
```text
λ(t) = α · f(t) + (1-α) · λ(t-1)  // Failure rate EMA
Circuit opens when: λ(t) > threshold OR consecutive_failures > limit
```

**API:**
```rust
let config = CircuitBreakerConfig {
    failure_threshold: 0.5,           // 50% failure rate
    consecutive_failure_threshold: 5,  // Or 5 consecutive failures
    recovery_timeout: Duration::from_secs(30),
    ema_alpha: 0.1,                   // Smoothing factor
    min_calls: 10,                     // Minimum calls before opening
};
let breaker = CircuitBreaker::new(config);

let result = breaker.call(|| {
    // Fallible operation
    risky_operation()
});
```

**Tests:** 8/8 passing
- Closed state success
- Consecutive failure detection
- Rate-based opening
- Automatic recovery
- Half-open trial logic
- Statistics tracking
- EMA smoothing

### 3. CheckpointManager (`checkpoint_manager.rs`)

**Purpose:** Atomic state snapshots for stateful recovery

**Key Features:**
- Checkpointable trait for easy integration
- Atomic writes via temp files + rename
- FNV-1a checksums for integrity verification
- Version management with pruning
- Performance overhead tracking (<5% target)
- Pluggable storage backends

**API:**
```rust
// Implement Checkpointable
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
struct MyComponent {
    state: Vec<f64>,
}

impl Checkpointable for MyComponent {
    fn component_id(&self) -> String {
        "my_component".to_string()
    }
}

// Usage
let storage = Arc::new(LocalStorageBackend::new("./checkpoints")?);
let manager = CheckpointManager::new(storage);

// Create checkpoint
let version = manager.checkpoint(&component)?;

// Restore latest
let restored: MyComponent = manager.restore("my_component")?;
```

**Tests:** 8/8 passing
- Metadata creation and verification
- Local storage write/read
- Version listing and sorting
- Latest checkpoint retrieval
- Checkpoint pruning
- Multiple version management
- Performance metrics
- Overhead calculation
