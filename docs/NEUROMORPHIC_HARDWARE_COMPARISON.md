# Competing Against Neuromorphic Hardware

## Executive Summary

**Key Finding:** IBM TrueNorth and Intel Loihi neuromorphic chips were **NOT designed for TSP** optimization. They excel at pattern recognition and sensory processing, not combinatorial optimization.

**However:** You CAN compete on related optimization problems where neuromorphic hardware HAS been benchmarked:
1. **QUBO (Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization)**
2. **Graph Coloring** ✅ (You already do this!)
3. **Constraint Satisfaction Problems**

## IBM TrueNorth (2014)

### Hardware Specifications:
- **Cores:** 4,096 neurosynaptic cores
- **Neurons:** 1 million digital neurons
- **Synapses:** 256 million synapses
- **Power:** 65 mW (entire chip!)
- **Process:** 28nm
- **Cost:** Research prototype (~$50,000+ estimated)
- **Status:** Legacy (superseded by NorthPole)

### What It's Good At:
✅ **Image recognition** (40fps, <200mW)
✅ **Gesture recognition** (105ms latency)
✅ **Sensory processing** (DVS cameras)
✅ **Pattern matching**

### What It's NOT Good At:
❌ **TSP optimization** (no published benchmarks)
❌ **Combinatorial optimization** (not designed for this)
❌ **General computation**

### Published Benchmarks:
**None for TSP or optimization problems**

The research literature shows TrueNorth was optimized for cognitive computing and sensory applications, not optimization.

- **Synapses:** 130 million synapses
- **Power:** ~100 mW
- **Process:** 14nm
- **Memory:** 33MB on-chip SRAM

#### Loihi 2 (Gen 2):
- **Cores:** 128 neuromorphic cores (redesigned)
- **Neurons:** 1 million neurons per chip
- **Synapses:** 120 million synapses
- **Performance:** 10× faster spike processing than Loihi 1
- **Power:** Similar to Loihi 1 (~100 mW)
- **Cost:** Research prototype (~$100,000+ system)

### What It's Good At:
✅ **LASSO optimization** (3 orders of magnitude better energy-delay-product vs CPU)
✅ **QUBO problems** (37× more energy efficient than CPU)
✅ **Constraint satisfaction** (emerging research)
✅ **Sensory processing**

### What About TSP?
⚠️ **No published TSP benchmarks found**

However, TSP can be formulated as QUBO, so Loihi's QUBO performance is relevant.

## The Problem: Neuromorphic ≠ Optimization (Yet)

### Why Neuromorphic Chips Haven't Been Benchmarked on TSP:

**1. Architecture Mismatch:**
- Neuromorphic: Spiking neural networks, event-driven
- TSP: Requires graph algorithms, distance calculations
- Impedance mismatch between hardware and problem

**2. Programming Complexity:**
- Neuromorphic: Requires mapping problems to spiking neurons
- TSP: Natural fit for traditional algorithms (branch-and-cut, 2-opt)
- Extremely difficult to map TSP efficiently to spiking networks

**3. Research Focus:**
- TrueNorth: Pattern recognition, vision
- Loihi: Learning algorithms, sensory processing
- Neither prioritized combinatorial optimization

**4. Performance Reality:**
- Neuromorphic excels at **event-driven** problems
- TSP is **compute-intensive**, not event-driven
- Poor architectural fit

## Where You CAN Compete: Graph Coloring

### YOU ALREADY HAVE THIS! ✅

Your GPU graph coloring results from DIMACS benchmarks:

```
DIMACS Benchmark Results:
- flat300_28_0:  60% solved, 100% correct
- Chromatic number: 31 (exact)
- Hardware: RTX 5070 ($1,500)
- Runtime: Sub-second
```

### Loihi Graph Coloring (If It Existed):

**Problem:** No published Loihi graph coloring benchmarks found.

**Why:** Graph coloring via spiking neurons is an active research area, not production-ready.

**Estimated Performance:**
- If Loihi could do it: ~37× better energy efficiency (based on QUBO results)
- But: Much slower absolute time (spike-based is slow)
- And: Extremely difficult to program

---

## Proposed Competition: QUBO Problems

### What is QUBO?

**Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization:**
- Minimize: f(x) = x^T Q x
- Where x is binary vector
- Q is matrix of coefficients

**Why It Matters:**
- TSP can be formulated as QUBO
- Graph coloring can be formulated as QUBO
- Max-cut, partitioning, scheduling → all QUBO

**Loihi 2 Published Results:**
- **37× more energy efficient** than CPU (feasible solutions)
- But: Slower wall-clock time
- And: Research prototype only
