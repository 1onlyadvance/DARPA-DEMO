# Legacy Documentation Archive

⚠️ **WARNING**: These documents are from pre-constitution development.

They are preserved for **historical reference only** and may contain:
- Outdated architecture descriptions
- Incorrect performance claims
- Forbidden pseudoscience terminology
- Superseded design decisions

## ❌ DO NOT USE THESE AS IMPLEMENTATION GUIDES

The **ONLY** authoritative source is:
**`../IMPLEMENTATION_CONSTITUTION.md v1.0.0`**

## Why These Are Archived

These documents were created before the constitution was established.
They may conflict with current requirements in:
- Scientific rigor (thermodynamic violations)
- Terminology (forbidden pseudoscience terms)
- Architecture (superseded by ADRs)
- Performance claims (unverified)

## Purpose of This Archive

These documents are kept for:
- Historical reference
- Understanding prior work
- Tracking project evolution
- Learning from past approaches

They do **NOT** represent:
- Current project direction
- Valid implementation guides
- Approved architectures
- Accurate performance data

## Current Authoritative Documents

See project root:
- IMPLEMENTATION_CONSTITUTION.md (supreme authority)
- PROJECT_STATUS.md (current progress)
- PROJECT_DASHBOARD.md (live metrics)
- ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md (approved designs)
- TESTING_STRATEGY.md (quality standards)
