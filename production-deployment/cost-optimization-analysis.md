```yaml
Phase 1 - Proof of Concept (Month 1-3):
  investment: $25,000
  deployment: 1x GPU server (2x RTX 5070)
  target: Validate performance claims
  expected_roi: 300% in 6 months

Phase 2 - Production Deployment (Month 4-6):
  investment: $75,000
  deployment: 3x GPU servers (6x RTX 5070)
  target: Handle 50% of production load
  expected_roi: 450% in 12 months

Phase 3 - Full Scale (Month 7-12):
  investment: $150,000
  deployment: 6x GPU servers (12x RTX 5070)

### 3. Advanced Cost Optimization Strategies

#### Dynamic Pricing Optimization

```rust
/// Dynamic cloud pricing optimization
pub struct DynamicPricingOptimizer {
    cloud_providers: Vec<CloudProvider>,
    spot_instance_manager: SpotInstanceManager,
    cost_predictor: CostPredictor,
}

impl DynamicPricingOptimizer {
    /// Find optimal cloud deployment based on current pricing
    pub async fn optimize_cloud_deployment(&self,
        workload_requirements: &WorkloadRequirements
    ) -> Result<OptimalDeployment, OptimizationError> {

        let mut best_deployment = None;
        let mut lowest_cost = f64::MAX;

        for provider in &self.cloud_providers {
            // Check spot instance availability and pricing
            let spot_options = self.spot_instance_manager
                .get_spot_options(provider, workload_requirements).await?;

            for spot_option in spot_options {
                let predicted_cost = self.cost_predictor
                    .predict_workload_cost(&spot_option, workload_requirements).await?;

                if predicted_cost.total_cost < lowest_cost &&
                   predicted_cost.availability_score > 0.95 {
                    lowest_cost = predicted_cost.total_cost;
                    best_deployment = Some(OptimalDeployment {
                        provider: provider.clone(),
                        instance_config: spot_option,
                        estimated_cost: predicted_cost,
                        risk_level: self.assess_risk_level(&predicted_cost),
                    });
                }
            }
        }

        best_deployment.ok_or(OptimizationError::NoViableDeployment)
    }

    /// Multi-cloud cost arbitrage
    pub async fn enable_cost_arbitrage(&self) -> Result<ArbitrageStrategy, OptimizationError> {
        // Monitor pricing across all cloud providers
        let pricing_data = self.collect_real_time_pricing().await?;

        // Identify cost-saving opportunities
        let opportunities = self.identify_arbitrage_opportunities(&pricing_data)?;

        // Create migration strategy
        let strategy = ArbitrageStrategy {
            source_deployment: opportunities.current_deployment.clone(),
            target_deployment: opportunities.optimal_deployment.clone(),
            estimated_savings: opportunities.cost_savings,
            migration_cost: opportunities.migration_overhead,
            net_benefit: opportunities.cost_savings - opportunities.migration_overhead,
            recommended_timing: opportunities.optimal_timing,
        };

        Ok(strategy)
    }
}
```
