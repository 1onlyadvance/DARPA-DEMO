## Critical Path Items

### Immediate Blockers
1. **GPU Solver Missing**: `solve_with_seed()` method doesn't exist
2. **CUDA Version**: cudarc doesn't support CUDA 12.8
3. **No Training Data**: Neural models need datasets
4. **No Benchmarks**: Need standard test problems

### Dependencies Needed
```toml
[dependencies]
# Real ML
tch = "0.16"  # PyTorch bindings
candle-core = { version = "0.7", features = ["cuda"] }

# Mathematical
nalgebra = "0.32"
ndarray-linalg = "0.16"
statrs = "0.16"

# Crypto for ZKP
bulletproofs = "4.0"
curve25519-dalek = "4.0"

# Market data
fix-rs = "0.1"
orderbook = "0.1"

# Molecular
bio = "1.0"
pdbtbx = "0.11"
```

## Resource Requirements

### Development Environment
- [x] NVIDIA RTX GPU with CUDA
- [x] 32GB+ RAM
- [x] Rust 1.75+
- [ ] CUDA Toolkit 12.0 (not 12.8)
- [ ] cuDNN 8.9+
- [ ] Python 3.10+ (for ML model training)

### Datasets Needed
- [ ] TSPLIB95 benchmark problems

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
1. **CUDA Compatibility**: May need to downgrade or patch cudarc
2. **Neural Training**: No existing trained models
3. **Quantum Scaling**: Path integral limited to small systems
4. **Latency Targets**: 100μs HFT very challenging

### Mitigation Strategy
1. Use Docker with CUDA 12.0 environment
2. Pre-train on synthetic data
3. Use tensor networks for large systems
4. Optimize critical path with assembly
