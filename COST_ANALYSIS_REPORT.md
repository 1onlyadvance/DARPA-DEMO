## 7. Neuromorphic Layer Value Analysis

### Performance Delta

| Problem Type | GPU-Only | Full Platform | Improvement | Value |
|--------------|----------|---------------|-------------|-------|
| **Small TSP** | 0.067s | 0.564s | -8.4× slower | Negative |
| **Medium TSP** | 0.074s | 0.100s | -1.35× slower | Marginal |

### Cost-Benefit by Problem Type

**When Full Platform Adds Value:**
1. **Dense constraint graphs** (5× speedup + better quality)
2. **Adaptive problems** (pattern detection useful)
3. **Multi-objective optimization** (physics coupling helps)

**When to Skip Full Platform:**
1. **Small problems** (<200 elements)
2. **Sparse graphs** (low constraint density)
3. **Single-objective, simple landscapes**

### Neuromorphic Layer Overhead Cost

- **Fixed overhead:** ~1.1s platform initialization
- **Per-problem overhead:** ~0.001s spike encoding
- **Break-even:** Problem must benefit by >1.1s to justify overhead

**Recommendation:** Use GPU-only baseline for problems <500 elements unless constraint density >40%.
