## Task Details

### Constitution Reference
IMPLEMENTATION_CONSTITUTION.md - Phase 4, Task 4.1

### Objective
Implement self-healing, fault-tolerant framework ensuring mission-critical reliability and high availability.

### Team Profile Requirements
- PhD in Distributed Systems (formal methods, consensus algorithms, snapshot algorithms)
- Principal Site Reliability Engineer (hyperscale experience, monitoring, automated recovery)

### Implementation Requirements

#### 1. HealthMonitor (src/resilience/fault_tolerance.rs)
- Component health tracking via DashMap<String, ComponentHealth>
- States: Healthy, Degraded, Unhealthy
- Global system states: Running, Degraded, Critical
- Graceful degradation logic

#### 2. CircuitBreaker (src/resilience/circuit_breaker.rs)
- States: Closed, Open, HalfOpen
- Configurable failure_threshold
- Recovery timeout with trial operations
- Prevent cascading failures

#### 3. CheckpointManager (src/resilience/checkpoint_manager.rs)
- Checkpointable trait for stateful components
- Periodic state snapshots
- Atomic writes to storage backend
- Restore from latest valid snapshot
- Checkpoint overhead < 5%

#### 4. Validation Suite (tests/resilience_tests.rs)
- Transient & cascading failure tests
- State integrity verification
- MTBF simulation > 1000 hours

### Validation Criteria
- [ ] CircuitBreaker prevents cascading failures
- [ ] State restore correctly reverts to checkpoint
- [ ] Checkpoint overhead < 5% of processing time
- [ ] MTBF > 1000 hours with random panic injection
- [ ] Graceful degradation maintains availability

## Notes
- Phase 3 complete: All 8 phases execute successfully
- Performance optimization from Phase 3 can be addressed in Task 4.2
- Focus on reliability and fault tolerance first
- Must maintain thermodynamic consistency during recovery
