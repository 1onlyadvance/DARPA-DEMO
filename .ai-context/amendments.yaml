    summary: |
      Adds Phase 6 to the constitution: Causal Manifold Annealing (CMA)
      A precision refinement engine that transforms the fast heuristic solver
      into a system with mathematically guaranteed precision bounds.

    key_additions:
      - "Three-stage CMA engine (thermodynamic, causal, quantum)"
      - "Neural enhancement layer for 100x performance"
      - "Mathematical guarantees via PAC-Bayes and conformal prediction"
      - "Application-specific adaptations (HFT, protein folding, materials)"
      - "Precision bounds: <5% approximation ratio, >99% confidence"

    validation_gates:
      - "Mathematical correctness with proofs"
      - "Implementation with 100% test coverage"
      - "Performance validation meeting targets"
      - "Application validation across domains"
