## Interpreting Your Results

### Benchmark Output Format

```
üìç Problem Size: 100 nodes

  n100_d5_s0 ... ‚úÖ 0.023s | MIS size: 87
  n100_d5_s1 ... ‚úÖ 0.021s | MIS size: 89
  ...

  Summary: 15 valid, avg time 0.022s, avg MIS size 88.3
```

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **Validity Rate:** Should be 100% (all solutions are valid independent sets)
2. **Average Time:** Compare with Loihi's "1ms" claim
3. **MIS Size:** Larger is better (solution quality)
4. **Total Runtime:** Should complete all 105 in 10-20 minutes

### Success Criteria

‚úÖ **100% validity** - All solutions must be valid
‚úÖ **Sub-second times** for problems ‚â§100 nodes
‚úÖ **Sub-10-second times** for problems ‚â§500 nodes
‚úÖ **Complete within 20 minutes** total

## For Your DARPA Proposal

### The Narrative

**"Practical Quantum-Inspired Computing on Accessible Hardware"**

We demonstrate competitive QUBO optimization performance on consumer hardware:

1. **Accessibility:** $1,500 laptop vs $100,000+ neuromorphic system
2. **Availability:** Purchase today vs research access only
3. **Versatility:** Same hardware solves TSP, graph coloring, QUBO
4. **Standards:** Standard programming tools vs exotic neuromorphic models

**Trade-off:** We accept higher energy consumption and slightly slower solve times in exchange for 67√ó lower cost and immediate accessibility.

**Value Proposition:** This bridges classical computing to quantum-inspired algorithms TODAY, while neuromorphic hardware remains in research labs.

### Key Statistics to Highlight

After running, use these in your proposal:

- **Problem Scale:** 105 benchmark instances (10-1000 variables)
- **Cost Efficiency:** 67√ó cheaper than neuromorphic hardware
- **Solution Quality:** [Fill in from your results] % average optimality
- **Solve Time:** [Fill in from your results] ms average
- **Accessibility:** Commercially available vs research prototype

## Troubleshooting

### If Build Fails
```bash
cargo clean
cargo build --release --example qubo_loihi_benchmark
```

### If Runtime is Too Long
The benchmark runs all 105 instances. To test a subset, modify the code:
```rust
// In examples/qubo_loihi_benchmark.rs, change:
let node_counts = vec![10, 25, 50]; // Instead of all sizes
```

### If Solutions Are Invalid
This indicates a bug in the solver. Check:
- Graph generation correctness
- QUBO formulation
- Solution validation logic

## Next Steps After Running

1. **Document Results** - Save the output for your proposal
2. **Compare Metrics** - Fill in actual times vs Loihi claims
3. **Create Graphs** - Plot solve time vs problem size
4. **Write Summary** - Honest comparison for DARPA proposal
